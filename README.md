# Dezigner App

This project was done as part of my campus final year project. It can draw different objects including rectangles, circles, text and lineswhich when brought together may for a website design, which was the main goal of this app

### `Interacting with the app`

Runs the app in the build mode.\
Open the [Dezigner app](https://ollaymkenya.github.io/dezigner/) to view it in the browser and interact with it.

### `Download`

For those who want to see and interact with the code, you have to download the source code from [Github](https://github.com/ollaymkenya/dezigner/) and once it opens you can open it with your favorite code editor, preferably, VS Code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`

To run the app in your localhost, you have to download it as indicated above and upon completion open a terminal in the dezigner-main folder and run the command: npm start. It will launch the app in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
